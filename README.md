# BE_Project_solar_water_cooler
The project presents the design, fabrication, and testing of a 5-liter volume water cooler employing an Intermittent Vapor Absorption Refrigeration System (VARS) powered by solar energy. 

The system utilizes an aqua-ammonia refrigerant-absorber pair to achieve the goal of producing chilled water at a target temperature of 5 degree Celsius within a 6-hour timeframe. 

Key components include an evaporator, condenser, and capillary tube, strategically integrated to harness solar energy efficiently. A Fresnel lens is employed for solar concentration onto the evaporator, ensuring optimal heat absorption. 

The project addresses material selection, design and safety considerations, and testing to validate the system's capability in providing a sustainable and reliable solution for cooling water through intermittent vapor absorption refrigeration.
